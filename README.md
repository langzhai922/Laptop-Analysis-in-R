## Laptop Dataset Exploration & Visualization ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
This project explores an unclean laptop dataset using R. I started by analyzing the raw data, identifying inconsistencies, and performing data cleaning to ensure accuracy. After preprocessing, I created visualizations to showcase the possibilities of working with data. This project showcases data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques in R.
